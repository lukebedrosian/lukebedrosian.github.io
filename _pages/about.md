**About Luke Bedrosian**

Greetings! I'm Luke Bedrosian, a passionate engineer and a recent graduate of Texas A&M University with a BS in Aerospace Engineering. Currently, I am employed as an Associate Member of Technical Staff in the System of Systems Engineering Department at The Aerospace Corporation.

**Professional Journey:**

In my role, I focus on developing software solutions to complex problems. I support varying projects within The Aerospace Corporation, primarily of which is as a software developer for The Portfolio Decision Support Tool (PDST), a space architecture modeling and visualization software tool (C++/Qt). I provide additional support to other projects including integrating software tools into data engineering pipelines (Python, Linux, C++, Qt, Apache Airflow), and building user interfaces for applications (C#, .NET, Matlab, Python).

**Academic Pursuits:**

While my undergraduate studies have concluded, my thirst for knowledge remains unquenched. I am embarking on a new academic journey, pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at The Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). This endeavor will expand my skill set and enhance my ability to tackle complex challenges in the realm of aerospace engineering and software development.
