**About Luke Bedrosian: Exploring the Cosmos Through Engineering and Creativity**

Hello! I'm Luke Bedrosian, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my personal corner of the digital universe. As a Senior Aerospace Engineering student at the prestigious Texas A&M University, I've embarked on a journey fueled by curiosity, innovation, and a drive to unravel the complexities of our universe.

**Education and Passion:**

Currently, I'm pursuing my degree in Aerospace Engineering with a keen focus on systems engineering principles. This passion drives me to find ingenious solutions during the early stages of space mission design. The challenge of crafting innovative solutions to complex problems is what fuels my academic pursuits.

With minors in Computer Science and Mathematics, I'm constantly expanding my toolkit to enhance my problem-solving capabilities. This multidisciplinary approach not only broadens my horizons but also equips me with a versatile skill set to address challenges from different angles.

**A Curious Mind and Varied Interests:**

I proudly identify as an eclectic Philomath, driven by an insatiable love for learning. My interests span a diverse spectrum - from the vast wonders of space to the exhilaration of weightlifting and the tranquility of hiking. My inquisitiveness extends to the realms of philosophy, where I contemplate life's profound questions. Since the beginning of my college journey, meditation has been my steadfast companion, guiding me through the ups and downs. To give you a glimpse into my personality, my Meyers-Briggs type is INTJ - a fitting reflection of my strategic, analytical, and imaginative nature.

**Leadership and Giving Back:**

Believing in the power of leadership and community, I proudly serve as the President of Paradigm. This dynamic organization allows me to channel my passion into tangible positive impacts. Leading this service, social, and philanthropy organization is both a privilege and a challenge that pushes me to continually grow.

**Aspiring Software Developer in the Space Enterprise:**

Looking ahead, I'm determined to merge my love for space with my passion for technology. My dream is to contribute as a software developer in the space enterprise, where I can bridge the gap between the cosmos and cutting-edge software solutions.

**Balancing Act:**

When I'm not delving into the intricacies of engineering, you'll find me unwinding in a variety of ways. Whether it's hitting the gym, strumming my guitar, exploring the world around me, or savoring quality time with friends, I cherish the richness of life's experiences.

**Professional Journey:**

Currently, I'm making strides as a System of Systems Engineering Intern at The Aerospace Corporation. In this role, I've independently developed and integrated graph analysis algorithms, and utilized probabilistic graph analysis to forecast satellite network performance. Additionally, I've dived into Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), crafting SysML models for a government customer's satellite ground enterprise.

My academic year includes research assistant responsibilities at the Systems Engineering, Architecture, and Knowledge Lab (SEAK). Here, I've developed software from scratch to aid in satellite design, implemented multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, and created simulation tools for thorough analysis.


Thank you for visiting my space on the web. I'm excited to continue this journey of discovery, growth, and innovation, and I invite you to join me every step of the way.
