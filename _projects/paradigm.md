**Paradigm: Forging Model Men of Aggieland**

Midway through my sophomore year of college, I decided I needed to push myself outside of personal and academic pursuits. I was involved in numerous aerospace-related organizations, including research, but I was lacking involvement in other areas of the college experience, so I decided to join [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm-tamu.org) - a service, social and philanthropy men's organization. This choice has been the greatest decision I've made in college; it's where I've met my closest friends, learned the most about myself, grown socially, given back to my community and grown as a leader. I'm unable to capture all of my experiences and the benefits of joining this organization, but here are a few of the highlights.

**Friends**

Through my involvement in the men's organization paradigm, I've had the incredible privilege of meeting friends who have become an integral part of my journey. These individuals consistently inspire me to strive for personal growth and to become a better version of myself. Their unwavering support extends beyond mere camaraderie; they actively challenge me to step beyond my comfort zone, embracing new experiences and opportunities that I might have hesitated to pursue alone. Their genuine, unrelenting love has illuminated the true essence of friendship, creating a strong and nurturing support system that uplifts me even in the face of adversity. As I spend time with each of them, I can't help but admire the remarkable qualities they possess â€“ qualities that I aspire to embody in my own life. Through our connections, I've learned that true friendship is a symbiotic journey of mutual growth, a journey I'm grateful to be on with these exceptional individuals by my side.

**Philanthropy**

At the end of my first semester in the organization, I ran for Philanthropy Executive with my good friend, RJ. I knew I wanted to step up into leadership, to have a say in major decisions, to push other members in the org, and to give back to a great cause. Our philanthropy is the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, which is very near and dear to me since I lost a friend in sixth-grade to Leukemia. In the fall 2022 semester, we introduced new fundraising methods for the cause, primarily using a big car wash event to raise money for the cause. We rented out a local car shop's water spout and set up car washing lanes for our members to wash the cars of their friends, family and other people in the community. Through this event and others planned during the fall semester, we proudly increased fall semester proceeeds by 300%, compared with the prior year.

During all of these fall activities, RJ and I began concocting a plan to entirely revamp our major philanthropy event, which takes place in the spring. The spring philanthropy event prior, Movie Night Under the Stars, lacked the excitement and entertainment required to drive out large numbers of students and families to our event. We decided to create a new event, Rock 'N' Reel, which includes live college bands, local vendors, yard games and a movie screening at the end. We held the event on campus at the brand new Aggie Park. Unforturnately, we were unable to host the vendors in our first annual event due to miscommunications with the university, but the event was a major success in spite of that! We had amazing crowds, the bands were great, we showed *Top Gun: Maverick,* and ended up raising over $10,000!

**President**

Running for the presidency of Paradigm was a decision fueled by a deep desire to challenge myself and expand my horizons. I saw this opportunity as a platform to put my leadership skills to the test, to engage in the art of effective communication and dialogue, and to refine my ability to inspire and guide a group towards a common vision. But most importantly, I felt that I was in a position to elevate our organization to new heights, fostering an environment of excellence and innovation. The pages of the Edmund Morris trilogy on Theodore Roosevelt provided me with a wellspring of inspiration, showcasing the transformative power of strong leadership and the impact it can have on an entire nation. I decided to embark on my own journey in my senior year of college.

Serving as President taught me far more about leadership than any other experience in my life. As the chief leader of over 80 men, I managed the planning and execution of large events and all orginizational functions.
