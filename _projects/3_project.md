**Paradigm: Forging Model Men of Aggieland**

Another book I'm currently devouring is *Crucial Conversations* by Grenny et al. This work breaks down the art of having crucial conversations, which are conversations when stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions start to run strong. My mentor at The Aerospace Corporation, where I am interning this summer, recommended this book. The ability to handle crucial conversations - correctly, that is - enables one to achieve greater success in our companies, careers, communities, relationships, personal health, etc. Already, this book flipped my worldview upside-down, and I'm excited to apply what I learn to all aspects of my life.
