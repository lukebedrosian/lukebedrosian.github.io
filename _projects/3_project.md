**Paradigm: Forging Model Men of Aggieland**

Midway through my sophomore year of college, I decided I needed to push myself outside of personal and academic pursuits. I was involved in numerous aerospace-related organizations, including research, but I was lacking involvement in other areas of the college experience, so I decided to join Paradigm - a service, social and philanthropy men's organization. This choice has been the greatest decision I've made in college; it's where I've met my closest friends, learned the most about myself, grown socially, given back to my community and grown as a leader. I'm unable to capture all of my experiences and the benefits of joining this organization, but here are a few of the highlights.

**Friends**


**Philanthropy**


**President**
