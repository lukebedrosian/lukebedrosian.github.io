**Paradigm: Forging Model Men of Aggieland**

Midway through my sophomore year of college, I decided I needed to push myself outside of personal and academic pursuits. I was involved in numerous aerospace-related organizations, including research, but I was lacking involvement in other areas of the college experience, so I decided to join Paradigm - a service, social and philanthropy men's organization. This choice has been the greatest decision I've made in college; it's where I've met my closest friends, learned the most about myself, grown socially, given back to my community and grown as a leader. I'm unable to capture all of my experiences and the benefits of joining this organization, but here are a few of the highlights.

**Philanthropy**

At the end of my first semester in the organization, I ran for Philanthropy Executive with my good friend, RJ. I knew I wanted to step up into leadership, to have a say in major decisions, to push other members in the org, and to give back to a great cause. Our philanthropy is the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, which is very near and dear to me since I lost a friend in sixth-grade to Leukemia. In the fall 2022 semester, we introduced new fundraising methods for the cause, primarily using a big car wash event to raise money for the cause. We rented out a local car shop's water spout and set up car washing lanes for our members to wash the cars of their friends, family and other people in the community. Through this event and others planned during the fall semester, we proudly increased fall semester proceeeds by 300%, compared with the prior year.

During all of these fall activities, RJ and I began concocting a plan to entirely revamp our major philanthropy event, which takes place in the spring. The spring philanthropy event prior, Movie Night Under the Stars, lacked the excitement and entertainment required to drive out large numbers of students and families to our event. We decided to create a new event, Rock 'N' Reel, which includes live college bands, local vendors, yard games and a movie screening at the end. We held the event on campus at the brand new Aggie Park. Unforturnately, we were unable to host the vendors in our first annual event due to miscommunications with the university, but the event was a major success in spite of that! We had amazing crowds, the bands were great, we showed *Top Gun: Maverick,* and ended up raising over $10,000!
