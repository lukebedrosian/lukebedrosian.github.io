I joined The Aerospace Corporation as an intern in May 2023. While searching for roles similar to my work in my [research lab](https://www.lukebedrosian.com/projects/seak/), I came across the position of System of Systems Engineer almost serendipitously. Although I wasn't familiar with the term "System of Systems" at the time, the job description seemed like a great fit for my background, so I decided to give it a try.

Throughout the summer internship, I had an amazing experience that exceeded my expectations. I had the opportunity to learn a lot about various areas, including system of systems concepts, enterprise engineering, software development, and SysML modeling. These new skills and insights have been incredibly valuable for my professional development.

## Portfolio Decision Support Tool

The main project I worked on was software development for the [Portfolio Decision Support Tool](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/epdf/10.2514/6.2015-4420). This tool integrates and visualizes multi-faceted architectural data in support of the acquisition decision making process. Here are a few of my contributions:

* Independently implemented various graph analysis algorithms in C++/Qt and worked as part of a software engineering team to incorporate them into an existing space architecture modeling and visualization software tool.
* Implemented probabilistic graph analysis algorithms using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate future performance of satellite networks.
* Used an agile workflow including using git/bitbucket and JIRA for managing tasks.

A few of the graph algorithms implemented were Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra, and the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm. These were all implemented using a custom graph class unique to PDST's generic data structures. Due to material sensitivity, I am unable to present the GUI or any other work regarding PDST.

## Cloud Service Providers

Another project I worked on with five other interns was modeling the five largest U.S. cloud providers in SysML using the Cameo Systems Modeler program. Throughout this project, I consistently stepped up into a leadership role. I led discussions with our government customer to establish rapport, clarify objectives, and define project scope, goals, and deliverables. I also led presentations of technical work and models to government customers in a clear and precise manner. Beyond these soft-skills, I also was the lead modeler, developing the architecture of our model, implementing a custom profile in Cameo for our model, and developing a region/domain view for our model. Again, due to material sensitivity, I am unable to present any diagrams or additional work regarding this project.

## Concept Design Center Study

During the internship, Aerospace flew all of the interns to its headquarters in El Segundo, California. Here, we participated in a Concept Design Center study, which applies cutting-edge digital engineering tools and approaches to provide relevant information and guidance in customersâ€™ decision-making processes. During this study, I produced requirements traceability and activity diagrams (ConOps) in SysML.
