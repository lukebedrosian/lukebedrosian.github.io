This summer, I've had the pleasure of interning at The Aerospace Corporation in Chantilly, Virginia. This is my first time on the east coast (minus Florida), and I've had a wonderful time exploring. Here are some of my travels.

After the long drive from College Station, TX to Fairfax County, VA, I spent my first free weekend exploring the U.S. capitol.

One of my bestfriends, Samantha, visited me and we explored the area further.

My work, The Aerospace Corporation, sent the interns to our headquarters in El Segundo, California (right next to the LA Air Force Base) to perform a Concept Design Center study. It was an amazing experience exploring the campus, swimming in the ocean after work each night, and going out into the Mojave Desert to launch the rockets we made.
